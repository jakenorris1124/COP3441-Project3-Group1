## How to Play
In this puzzle game, you will place various different objects to guide the ball throughout the level towards the goal. You get more points the less you place down objects.

Once in a level, placing an object is easy. All you have to do is click on the name of the object you want then click in the area you want to place it. After placing, you can drag objects around to move them. Also, right clicking an object will rotate it. To remove an object, simply drag it back towards the sidebar.

Once you have placed some objects, you can hit the `Start` button to start the simulation. To stop it, simply hit `Stop`. Stopping the simulation will set objects back to their default state and will place the ball back to the start.

## Anchor
The anchor will make it so objects are not affected by changes in gravity.

## Button
The button will toggle EVERY object that can be toggled. It can be pressed by having a ball hit it.

## Directional Gate
The directional gate will only allow the ball to pass through it in the direction of the arrows. So, when the ball approaches it from arched side, the ball will pass right through. However, when the ball comes from the straight side, it will act as a solid surface.

## Fan
The fans will blow the ball in the direction it is facing. To activate the fan, you can either have the ball hit the fan, or the ball press a button.

## Gravity Inverter
The gravity inverter will flip the world's gravity upside, causing the ball to go upwards. To activate the gravity inverter, you can either have the ball hit the finverter, or the ball press a button.

## Heavy Ball Transformer
The heavy ball transformer will make the ball weigh more. To activate the transformer, you can either have the ball hit the transformer, or the ball press a button.

## Light Ball Transformer
The light ball transformer will make the ball weigh less. To activate the transformer, you can either have the ball hit the transformer, or the ball press a button.

## Light Bridges
The light bridge will shoot out a beam of light that will go out until it hits something. If it doesn't hit anything, the beam will dissappear. The light beam is solid, allowing the ball to roll on it. To activate the light bridge you can have the ball press a button.

## Lift
The lift will rise vertically when activated. To activate the lift you can have the ball press a button.

## Spring
The spring will bounce the ball if the ball lands on top of it.
